The Architecture Guide provides an introduction and overview of the Magento product. Important concepts about the technology stack and fundamental design and architecture are covered in this guide.

The Magento platform and components are explained from the perspective of several audiences: merchants, web store developers (frontend developers), extension developers, system admins, installers, and integrators.

More detailed information about building online stores, using the Magento APIs, installing, configuring, and extending the platform is included in other books in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}index.html">Magento library</a>.
