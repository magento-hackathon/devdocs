<h2 id="contribute">DevDocs contributions</h2>

What's your area of expertise? Please share your knowledge with us! Contributions can take the form of completely new topics, changes and edits to existing documentation, or just good suggestions. 

We have a <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}contributor-guide/basic_template.html" target="_blank">template</a> to make getting started easy. You can get a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/blob/2.0/guides/v2.0/contributor-guide/basic_template.md">.md file  on Github</a>. It's in Markdown, which is a simple markup language.

We also have a <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}contributor-guide/contributing_docs_suggested_topics.html" target="_blank">list of suggested topics</a>, if you want to peruse and pick one that appeals to you.

If you write and contribute a full topic, we'll put your name (or company's name) at the top of the page, right under the title, and link it to your blog or website! And you'll get your face and bio in the <a href="{{ site.gdeurl }}howdoi/howdoi_bios.html">ring of honor</a> as one of our featured contributors.

Use the <a href="#fork">fork</a> & <a href="#pull_request">pull</a> model to contribute to the Magento 2 DevDocs.
This contribution model means that contributors maintain their own copy of the forked codebase (which can be easily synced with the main copy). The forked repository is then used to submit a request to the base repository to *pull* a set of changes (hence the phrase *pull request*).

The Magento DevDocs team reviews all issues and contributions submitted by the community. During the review we might require clarifications from the contributor. If you know what you want to write about, but you aren't sure where within our multiple documents the topic should go, we can help you with the "info architecture" part.

<!--
Often when the Magento DevDocs team works on reviewing the suggested changes, we will add a label to the issue to indicate certain information, like status or who is working the issue. If you're ever curious what the different labels mean, see the <a href="#labels">table</a> below for an explanation of each one.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
<p>Please refer to <a href="http://www.magento.com/legaldocuments/mca">Magento Contributor Agreement</a> for detailed information about the License Agreement. All contributors are required to submit a click-through form to agree to the terms. </p>

<h2 id="requirements">Contribution guidelines</h2>


1. Some common writing guidelines include:
    * Define what the goal of your topic is: what exactly do you want to teach the reader?
    * Make the title of your topic reflect the content.
    * Keep your sentences concise, and try to separate conceptual information from procedural steps.
    * Remember to use active voice (not passive), write in the present tense, and use a friendly tone in second person (i.e. "You can now view the output...")
    * Use Notes and even Warnings to alert readers to particularly important details (our template has the markdown syntax!).
    * Use cross-references to other topics if it is appropriate. We can help you with that syntax too, and the template has an example.
    
2. Focus on the content and on creating useful information for your fellow Magento developers and community members, but do please take a few editorial passes at your work before submitting your topic and look for typos, formatting errors, or sentences that need clarifying. 
3. Familiarize yourself with the existing documentation; taking a look at what is already there will help you decide where your topic best fits and if there are other topics to which you might want to add cross-references in your topic.
4. First, check the <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/pulls" target="_blank">existing PRs</a> and make sure you are not duplicating others’ work!
5. For large contributions or changes that include multiple files, please <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/issues" target="_blank">open an issue</a> and discuss first. This may prevent duplicate or unnecessary effort, and the DevDocs team can help find the best home for your new topics.

<h2 id="fork">Fork a repository</h2>
To fork a repository on Github, do the following:

1. Create or log in to your developemnt environment account on GitHub. 

2. Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs" target="_blank">DevDocs repository</a>.

3. Click **Fork** at the top right.

4. Clone the repo into your development environment and then start writing and committing your changes. Optionally create a branch first if you plan to work on mulitple changes.

5. You can build this site using Jekyll by following the <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs#user-content-building-this-site" target="_blank">instructions here</a>. 

<h2 id="pull_request">Create a pull request</h2>

To create a pull request do the following: 

1. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

2. In your forked repository, click **New pull request**.

3. Be sure to create the pull request to the correct branch (the base). Our branches are numbered (2.0, 2.1, and so on). We don't accept PRs to other branches, like gh-pages.

4. Review the changes, then click **Create pull request**. Fill out the form, and click **Create pull request** again to submit the PR&mdash;that’s it!

After submitting your PR, you can head over to the DevDocs repository’s <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/pulls" target="_blank">Pull Requests panel</a> to see your PR along with the others. The DevDocs team will review your contribution, and get back with you if we have any questions. Once the final content is ready, we will merge your PR into the repo, and your work will be published to the repo and to <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs" target="_blank">devdocs.magento.com</a>. If you write a whole topic, or make substantial contributions to an existing topic, we will add your name right below the title, linked to your blog or site!

<h2 id="report">Report an issue</h2>
If you find a typo or erroneous information in Magento DevDocs, you can either fix it with a PR (as described above) or you can simply report it by creating an issue in the DevDocs repository.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  <p>Before creating an issue, please check the <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/issues" target="_blank"> existing issues</a> to make sure that the issue wasn't already reported.
</p>
</div>

To add an issue:

1. In the <a href="https://github.com/magento/devdocs/issues" target="_blank">DevDocs repository's Issues panel</a>, click  **New issue**  on the right. 
2. Fill in the Title and issue description.
3. Click **Submit new issue**.
